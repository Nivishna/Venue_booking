# Venue_booking
This online venue booking system aims to modernize college space management for classrooms and auditoriums. By offering a central platform for reservations, it streamlines booking processes for faculty. This web-based system will improve efficiency, eliminate confusion over availability, and empower users to manage their schedules with ease. Ultimately, this project will benefit the entire college community by creating a transparent and convenient space reservation system.
Scope of the project:
 The main aim of this project is to develop an online venue booking system for your college's classrooms and auditoriums. It will focus on functionalities like user login, venue search with filters (capacity, A/V equipment), real-time availability display, online booking with confirmation, and potentially cancellation options. The system will prioritize user-friendliness for faculty.
